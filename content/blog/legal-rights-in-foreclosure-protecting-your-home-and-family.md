## Legal Rights in Foreclosure: Understanding Your Protections

Foreclosure—a term that strikes worry into the hearts of homeowners—can be a distressing process. When the shadow of losing your home looms, it's crucial to grasp the legal rights and defenses designed to protect families during these trying times.

### The Foreclosure Process and Your Rights

**Foreclosure** is the legal action taken by a lender to seize a property when a borrower fails to make mortgage payments. To **foreclose** means to strip the homeowner of their ownership rights, often resulting in the sale of the home to recover the unpaid loan balance.

Understanding the **foreclosure timeline** is pivotal. It begins with a missed payment and can end in a **foreclosure sale**, but there are numerous steps in between where homeowners can intervene.

Before a lender can proceed with foreclosure, they must issue a **notice of intent to foreclose**. This document serves as a formal warning and can be the first step for homeowners to take action to **keep your home**.

### Writing a Foreclosure Letter to the Lender

A **foreclosure letter** is a borrower’s attempt to communicate with their lender regarding their mortgage predicament. To **write a foreclosure letter** effectively, include your **loan account number** and explain any hardship causing the missed payments.
