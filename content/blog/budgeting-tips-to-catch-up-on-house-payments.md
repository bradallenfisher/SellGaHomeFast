  - Understand that **forbearance options** vary and may include a **repayment plan** or a **lump-sum payment** once the **forbearance period ends**.

### Refinancing Your Mortgage

**Refinancing** could be a viable solution to lower your **monthly payment** through a **new loan** with a lower **interest rate** or a longer **loan term**.
  - Consider the closing costs of a **refinance** versus the long-term savings on your **mortgage payment**.
  - **Interest rate** reductions can have a significant impact on your budget, making it easier to **repay** your loan without falling behind again.

### Loan Modification as a Long-Term Solution

**Loan modification** is a process wherein your **lender** agrees to alter the terms of your mortgage, making payments more manageable.
  - Discuss with your **mortgage servicer** the possibility of extending the **loan term**, reducing the **interest rate**, or even reducing the principal owed.
  - Remember to consult with a **housing counselor** approved by the **Department of Housing and Urban** Development for guidance.

### Negotiating a Repayment Plan

### Strategies for Budgeting and Saving

Successfully catching up on house payments also requires a close examination of your budget to **temporarily suspend or reduce** expenses.

  - Reach out to organizations like **Fannie Mae** or the **Department of Housing and Urban Development** for additional assistance and programs designed to help homeowners.

### Alternative Solutions in Worst-Case Scenarios

If you're unable to catch up and maintain your mortgage payments, itâ€™s crucial to consider alternatives like a **short sale** or **deed in lieu** of foreclosure.
  - A **short sale** may allow you to sell your home for less than what you owe with your lender's permission.
