We'll explore strategic approaches to managing liens and ensuring successful property sales.

  - **Judgment liens**: resulting from a court ruling against the property owner in a lawsuit.
  - **Involuntary liens**: like mechanicâ€™s liens, not consented to by the property owner.

When selling, prioritize understanding each lien's nuances, including its origin, the amount owed, and the process for resolution.

### Conducting a Thorough Property Lien Search

Initiate a **property lien search** to identify any and all encumbrances on your home. This crucial step will help you understand the extent of liens and strategize how to address them effectively before listing your home.

3. **Dispute the lien**: If the lien is incorrect, you may contest it through legal channels.
4. **Settle through closing**: At times, liens can be paid from the proceeds of the home sale during closing.

In every instance, securing a **release of lien** upon settlement is critical.

### When to Consult a Real Estate Attorney

Complex lien situations often require professional guidance. A seasoned **real estate attorney** can navigate the intricacies of lien resolution and protect your interests during the sale process.

  - **Offer a discount**: Adjusting the sale price to account for liens can attract buyers willing to handle them.
