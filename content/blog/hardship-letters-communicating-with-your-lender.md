## Hardship Letters: Communicating with Your Lender

3. **New Loan**: Thoroughly review the terms to ensure that refinancing offers true benefits over your existing mortgage.

### Pursuing a Loan Modification

Sometimes, a change in loan terms can make all the difference. A **loan modification** alters the existing mortgage contract to provide affordability in line with the homeowner's current **financial situation**.
  - **Mortgage Modification**: This could involve lowering the interest rate, extending the loan term, or reducing the principal balance.
  - **Avoid Foreclosure**: By modifying your loan, you are taking proactive steps to prevent losing your home.
  - **Repay**: Always have a clear plan on how you will manage the modified payments.

  - **Housing and Urban Development (HUD)**: Seek advice from a HUD-approved **housing counselor**.
  - **Financial Hardship**: Demonstrate your inability to continue with payments.
  - **Foreclosure Process**: Be aware that both short sales and foreclosures can significantly impact your credit.

Applying for forbearance should not be taken lightly.
  - **Documentation**: Prepare detailed documentation of your financial hardship.
