## The Great Recession and the Housing Market

### The Role of the Housing Market in the Great Recession

The **Great Recession**, marked by the **2008 housing crash**, was inextricably linked to the housing market. Misleading **mortgage** practices and overly optimistic speculation led to a **real estate bubble** that, once burst, had catastrophic consequences.
